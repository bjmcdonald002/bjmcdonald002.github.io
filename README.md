Welcome to my data science portfolio. I'm a Ph.D. student in mathematics (statistics concentration) with a focus on predictive modeling, robust statistics, and data-driven research. This site showcases selected projects and skills I've developed through academic research and independent work.

## 🔍 Projects

- **[League of Legends Win Prediction](https://github.com/bjmcdonald002/lol-win-predict)**  
  Trained multiple binary classifiers (XGBoost, LightGBM, neural nets, PCA + logistic regression) on ranked solo/duo match data. Validated using k-fold CV and shuffle tests. Full methodology and results available.

- **[Linear Regression via Gradient Descent](https://github.com/bjmcdonald002/linear-regression-gd)**  
  Trained gradient‑descent regressor on 15 feature‑set combinations with 5‑fold cross‑validation and early stopping (75 total runs) to pinpoint the most predictive inputs.

- **[Cryptocurrency Forecasting](https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-pca-chaos)** ![Coming Soon](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-coming%20soon-lightgrey)  
  Developing forecasting models using statistical and machine learning algorithms.
